# Ibis Transport: A (Work In Progress) All In One App For Your NSW Transport Needs

## Why is this a thing?
Navigating NSW's public transport can be very confusing with all the trains, buses, ferrys, light rails (fancy trains) and metro; and this app aims to combine everything you'd need into a single app that is easy to use. Its meant for both locals (like me!) and tourists alike to make life a lot easier. I'll be using this app every day so you know I'll put my best into it.

## How does it work?
NSW OpenData has kindly provided us with APIs that give a lot of data about the entire transport network. Currently there aren't too many easy to use ways to use it though, so this app compiles it all into one easy to use app. Everything from timetables to nearby stations to train locations to track work will be here and easy to access

## How is it made?
The app is a native iOS app made entirely using Swift and SwiftUI in XCode. [Alamofire]([url](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)) is used to make the requests to the API. And of course the API is provided and maintaned by NSW OpenData.Â Everything else is made by me!!!

## How can you use the app?
Currently the only way to run it is by cloning it and running it on XCode on either a simulator or putting it on a real device. Unfortunately I'm under 18 so I can't get it on the app store or testflight but when its finished I will release an IPA file if you use AltStore or SideStore on your phone. You'll need iOS 18 (currently in beta) or higher to run it because it was coded using the latest XCode beta.
